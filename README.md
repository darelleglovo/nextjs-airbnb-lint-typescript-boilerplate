# Boilerplate for Next.js with Typescript and airbnb-lint setup
- Typescript
- airbnb-lint

I'm a huge fan of airbnb-lint but I disabled some rules that I think is too strict. I haven't disabled a lot yet but I will disable it along the way.
Feel free to also add/disable rules that you don't like! - in `.eslintrc`.
You decide what is your rules, this is just a boilerplate. :D


# To run:
