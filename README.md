# Boilerplate for Next.js with Typescript and airbnb-lint setup
What's in here:
- NextJS v9,4,2
- React v16.13.1
- Typescript v13.9.1
- airbnb-lint

I'm a huge fan of airbnb-lint (because it forces us to write clean and maintainable code) but I disabled some rules that I think is too strict. I haven't disabled a lot yet but I will disable it along the way.
Feel free to also add/disable rules that you don't like! - in `.eslintrc`.
You decide what is your rules, this is just a boilerplate. :D

# Install first
```bash
npm install
```
# To run: 
```bash
npm run dev
```

# To lint:
```bash
npm run lint
```
to fix:
```bash
npm run lint:fix
```
